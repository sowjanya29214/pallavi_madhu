        <h>SOCIAL MEDIA</h>
    </figure>
    <p>The evolution of social media has been fueled by the human impulse to communicate and by advances in digital
        technology. It is a story about establishing and nurturing personal connections at scale. According to
        Merriam-Webster, social media is defined as “forms of electronic communication (such as websites
        for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information,
        ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).” The 2019 Pew Research Center report on social
        media use in the United States showed that 72% of American adults use some form of social media. In 2005, the
        year after Facebook went live, that number was 5%.</p>

        <h1></h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>
    </figure>
    <P>In less than a generation, social media has evolved from direct electronic information exchange, to virtual
        gathering place, to retail platform, to vital 21st-century marketing tool.</P>
    <p>In the 1980s and ’90s, according to “The History of Social Networking” on the technology news site Digital
        Trends, the internet’s growth enabled the introduction of online communication services such as CompuServe,
        America Online, and Prodigy. They introduced users to digital communication through email, bulletin board
        messaging, and real-time online chatting.

        This gave rise to the earliest social media networks, beginning with the short-lived Six Degrees profile
        uploading service in 1997.

        This service was followed in 2001 by Friendster. These rudimentary platforms attracted millions of users and
        enabled email address registration and basic online networking.

        Weblogs, or blogs, another early form of digital social communication, began to gain popularity with the 1999
        launch of the LiveJournal publishing site. This coincided with the launch of the Blogger publishing platform by
        the tech company Pyra Labs, which was purchased by Google in 2003.

        In 2002, LinkedIn was founded as a networking site for career-minded professionals. By 2020, it had grown to
        more than 675 million users worldwide. It remains the social media site of choice for job seekers as well as
        human resources managers searching for qualified candidates.

        Two other major forays into social media collapsed after a burst of initial success. In 2003, Myspace launched.
        By 2006, it was the most visited website on the planet, spurred by users’ ability to share new music directly on
        their profile pages.

        By 2008, it was eclipsed by Facebook. In 2011, Myspace was purchased by musician Justin Timberlake for $35
        million, but it has since become a social media afterthought.

        Google’s attempt to elbow its way into the social media landscape, Google+, launched in 2012. A rocky existence
        came to an end in 2018, after the private information of nearly 500,000 Google+ users was compromised by a data
        security breach.</p>
