    <p>Hanuman is one of several zoomorphic characters in Indian mythology, but is the only wholly animal figure who is
        revered as a god today. The mythic texts speak of him as a monkey child of the Wind God, as possessing enormous
        strength, keen intellect and a mastery over the Vedas and other branches of learning. He is also an
        unquestioning devotee of Rama, the hero of the epic Ramayana, and has the ability to take on any form he wishes.
    </p>
    <p1>Hanuman was the son of Kesari, a vanar, and the grandson of Brihaspati, the king of Sumeru. His mother Anjana,
        was an apsara of the heavens and had descended to the earth as human, due to a curse. She and her husband had
        performed 12 years of penance and intense prayers due to which, Shiva granted them a child, as a boon. The child
        was Hanuman himself, due to which he is also interpreted as the reflection or shadow of Lord Shiva himself.
        Other mythological accounts often called Hanuman, as the son of The God of Wind, Vayu Dev, due to the popular
        story of the Wind God delivering a sacred pudding to Anjana, which originated from King Dasharatha’s ritual of
        Putrakama Yagya. The same pudding was had by the three wives of King Dasharatha, leading to the birth of Rama,
        Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. This pudding was delivered to her while performing her prayers to Shiva, who
        steered the Vayu God’s energy into the womb of Anjana. Hence, Hanuman is popularly known as Vayuputra.

        Hanuman’s childhood tales are a source of great entertainment, told by grandmothers to the children. Hanuman was
        a very adventurous and restless child. He is believed to have mistaken the sun to be a ripe and mango, and he
        pursued it in order to eat it. Rahu, a Vedic planet, was also pursuing the Sun at that time for a scheduled
        eclipse, and Hanuman thrashed him in order to reach the Sun first. This angered Lord Indra, who struck Hanuman
        with a thunderbolt. Hanuman fell back to the earth, unconscious, and also damaged his chin, leaving a permanent
        mark on it. This incident enraged Vayu Dev, his father figure, who sucked out all the air from the universe.
        When all the humans and animals began to struggle for air, Lord Indra withdrew the effect of his thunderbolt,
        and revived Hanuman, and was also blessed with multiple boons, by the devas, to pacify the Wind God.</p1>
