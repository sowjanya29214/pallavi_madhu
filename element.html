    <figure align="center"><h>MY FATHER</h></figure>
    <p> A father is a responsible, dutiful and caring person who loves his children unconditionally. Fathers are
        generally hard-working to meet their family needs and provide a comfortable life. A father always supports his
        children’s dreams and desires. To make ends meet, he sacrifices his own happiness many times. They are rightly
        called the head of the family and stand tall as the backbone of the entire family.</p>
        <figure align="center"> <h>MY MOTHER</h></figure>
    <p>First of all, Mother is a word which fills everyone with emotions. A Mother is certainly the most important human
        being in everyone’s life. Mother’s Love for her child certainly cannot be compared with anything. Her level of
        forgiveness is unmatchable. A Mother is capable of forgiving any wrongdoing. Mother is the most important woman
        in everyone’s life. A mother sacrifices her happiness for her child. No one else can care for their kids the way
        a Mother does. A Mother is great and does not need anyone like me explaining that. This essay on Mother is a
        small attempt to discover the greatness of a mother.</p>
        <figure align="center" ><h>MY SISTER</h></figure>
    <p>Sisters are a blessing for everyone in this world. Many of us have sisters whom we love unconditionally. Some
        have elder sisters while others have younger sisters. Nonetheless, we all are lucky to have been blessed with
        sisters. Through my sister essay, I will tell more about my sister and my unconditional love for her.</p>
