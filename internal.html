        <h>A GIRL'S FIRST TRUE LOVE IS HER FATHER</h>
    <p>A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may
        have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and
        obligations. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual
        intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such
        as an obligation of monetary support. An adoptive father is a man who has become the child's parent through the
        legal process of adoption. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but
        has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a
        family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to
        the child.When my daughter was younger and feeling down or insecure she would crawl into my lap. Then she would
        nestle her head in my chest. I would wrap my arms around her. Then I would tell her I loved her and she would
        always let out a deep relaxing exhale. It’s as if all those things that were weighing on her left her shoulders.
        It still
        happens, but now that she has gotten bigger she more cuddles up next to me, but when I tell her I love her she
        still lets out the same calming breath.As a girl grows up, men will come in and out of her life, but the one man
        who will always be there is her father. The father-daughter relationship plays a vital role in his girl’s
        journey to adulthood. Below are 7 things a daughter needs from her dad. Our printable version is below.Building
        a father-daughter relationship at
        a young age is an essential aspect of a girl’s psychological adjustments. Being emotionally attached to her
        father benefits a girl throughout her life. Here are some reasons why a strong bond between the father and
        daughter is crucial: Fathers are role models. They lay a foundation of security, trust, and love.
        Daughters tend to judge all the other men who come into their lives later based on the example their fathers set
        for them. A girl develops confidence and self-esteem if she has a good bond with her father.
        When a father gets involved in his daughter’s education, she tends to do better as compared to girls whose
        fathers never get involved. Girls have a better career because of the early influence of their fathers. They
        become more successful and achievement-oriented.A loving father makes his daughter feel good about herself as he
        helps her during every
        stage of her life.Building a father-daughter relationship at a young age is an essential aspect of a girl’s

        daughter needs her father's approval. She wants to know that he thinks well of her choice of partner. She also
        needs his support when things don't go according to plan. A daughter looks to her father for guidance -
        especially when making important decisions about her future. He can help her find her way by showing her
        examples from his own life.A daughter also needs her father to be happy. Whether it's seeing him laugh or cry,
        she wants to make him feel
        appreciated and loved. Sometimes this means doing things for him even though they're not her favorite tasks (for
        example, cleaning out his garage). The point is for him to know that she cares about him enough to want him to
        be comfortable and happy.Finally, a daughter needs her father to be herself. She doesn't want him to try and
        change who she is for the
        sake of the relationship. This is especially important if she sees him as a role model.</p>
