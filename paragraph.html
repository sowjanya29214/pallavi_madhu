    <p>Hanuman is one of the more popular deities in the Hindu pantheon, and is widely worshiped as a magical deity who
        has the ability to conquer evil spirits. He is particularly popular with body-builders, since his life of
        celibacy parallels the Hindu notion that sexual desires must be controlled in order to strengthen the physical
        form.[1] However, Hanuman remains most important in Hinduism as a prototype of the ideal worshipper rather than
        as an object of worship.</p>
