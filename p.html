    <h5>Hanuman is one of the central characters of the Hindu epic Ramayana. He is an ardent devotee of Rama and one of
        the Chiranjivis. Hanuman is regarded to be the son of the wind-god Vayu, who in several stories played a direct
        role in Hanuman's birth.[6][9] Hanuman is considered to be an incarnation of Vayu in Sadh Vaishnavism and few
        other Vaishnava traditions, while in Shaivism he is considered to be a partial incarnation of Shiva</h5><br>

    <h3>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <h4>VEDIC ROOTS</h4>
    The earliest mention of a divine monkey, interpreted by some scholars as the proto-Hanuman, is in hymn 10.86 of the
    Rigveda, dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. The twenty-three verses of the hymn are a metaphorical and
    riddle-filled legend. It is presented as a dialogue between multiple characters: the god Indra, his wife Indrani and
    an energetic monkey it refers to as Vrisakapi and his wife Kapi.[24][25][26] The hymn opens with Indrani complaining
    to Indra that some of the soma offerings for Indra have been allocated to the energetic and strong monkey, and the
    people are forgetting Indra. The king of the gods, Indra, responds by telling his wife that the living being
    (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully. The
    hymn closes with all agreeing that they should come together in Indra's house and share the wealth of the
    offerings.<br>
    <h4>PROTO DRAVIDIAN ROOTS</h4><br>
    The orientalist F. E. Pargiter (1852–1927) theorized that Hanuman was a proto-Dravidian deity.[27] According to
    this theory, the name "Hanuman" derives from Tamil word for male monkey (ana-mandi), first transformed to
    "Anumant" – a name which remains in use. "Anumant", according to this hypothesis, was later Sanskritized to
    "Hanuman" because the ancient Aryans confronted with a popular monkey deity of ancient Dravidians coopted the
    concept and then Sanskritized it.[26][28] According to Murray Emeneau, known for his Tamil linguistic studies,
    this theory does not make sense because the Old Tamil word mandi in Sangam literature can only mean "female
    monkey", and Hanuman is male. Further, adds Emeneau, the compound ana-mandi makes no semantic sense in Tamil,
    which has well developed and sophisticated grammar and semantic rules. The "prominent jaw" etymology, according
    to Emeneau, is therefore plausible.<BR>
    <h4>CHILDHOOD</h4><br>
    According to Valmiki's Ramayana, one morning in his childhood, Hanuman was hungry and saw the rising red-colored
    sun. Mistaking it for a ripe fruit, he leapt up to eat it. In one version of the Hindu legend, the king of gods
    Indra intervened and struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt. It hit Hanuman on his jaw, and he fell to the earth dead
    with a broken jaw. Hanuman's father Vayu (air) became upset and withdrew all the air on Earth. The lack of air
    created immense suffering to all living beings. This led lord Shiva to intervene and resuscitate Hanuman, which in
    turn prompted Vayu to return to the living beings. As the mistake was done by the god Indra, he grants Hanuman a
    wish that his body would be as strong as Indra's Vajra, and that his Vajra can also not harm him. Along with Indra
    other gods have also granted him wishes: the God Agni granted Hanuman a wish that fire won't harm him; God Varuna
    granted a wish for Hanuman that water won't harm him; God Vayu granted a wish for Hanuman that he will be as fast as
    wind and the wind won't harm him. Lord Brahma also granted Hanuman a wish that he can move to any place where he
    cannot be stopped. Hence these wishes make Hanuman an immortal, who has unique powers and strength.[52]

    In another Hindu version of his childhood legend, which Lutgendorf states is likely older and also found in Jain
    texts such as the 8th-century Dhurtakhyana, Hanuman's Icarus-like leap for the sun proves to be fatal and he is
    burnt to ashes from the sun's heat. His ashes fall onto the earth and oceans.[53] Gods then gather the ashes and his
    bones from land and, with the help of fishes, re-assemble him. They find everything except one fragment of his
    jawbone. His great-grandfather on his mother's side then asks Surya to restore the child to life. Surya returns him
    to life, but Hanuman is left with a disfigured jaw.[53] Hanuman is said to have spent his childhood in
    Kishkindha.<br>
    <h4>ADULTHOOD</h4>
    <H5>RAMAYANA</H5>
    There is quite a lot of variation between what happens between his childhood and the events of the Ramayana, but
    his story becomes much more solid in the events of the Ramayana. After Rama and his brother Lakshmana, searching
    for Rama's kidnapped wife, Sita, arrive in Kishkindha, the new king, and Rama's newfound ally the monkey king
    Sugriva, agree to send scouts in all four directions to search for Rama's missing wife. To the south, Sugriva
    sends Hanuman and some others, including the great bear Jambavan. This group travels all the way to the
    southernmost tip of India, where they encounter the ocean with the island of Lanka (modern day Sri Lanka)
    visible in the horizon. The group wishes to investigate the island, but none can swim or jump so far (it was
    common for such supernatural powers to be common amongst characters in these epics). However, Jambavan knows
    from prior events that Hanuman used to be able to do such a feat with ease, and lifts his curse.<br>
    <h5>MAHABARATHA</H5><BR>
    Centuries after the events of the Ramayana, and during the events of the Mahabharata, Hanuman is now a nearly
    forgotten demigod living his life in a forest. After some time, his spiritual brother through the god Vayu, Bhima,
    passes through looking for flowers for his wife. Hanuman senses this and decides to teach him a lesson, as Bhima had
    been known to be boastful of his superhuman strength (at this point in time supernatural powers were much rarer than
    in the Ramayana but still seen in the Hindu epics). Bhima encountered Hanuman lying on the ground in the shape of a
    feeble old monkey. He asked Hanuman to move, but he would not. As stepping over an individual was considered
    extremely disrespectful in this time, Hanuman suggested lifting his tail up to create a passage. Bhima heartily
    accepted, but could not lift the tail to any avail.[56]

    Bhima, humbled, realized that the frail monkey was some sort of deity, and asked him to reveal himself. Hanuman
    revealed himself, much to Bhima's surprise, and the brothers embraced. Hanuman prophesied that Bhima would soon be a
    part of a terrible war, and promised Bhima that he would sit on the flag of his brother Arjuna's chariot and shout a
    battle cry for Bhima that would weaken the hearts of his enemies. Content, Hanuman left his brother to his search,
    and after that prophesied war, would not be seen again until early 1600s.
