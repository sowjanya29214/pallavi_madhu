    <p>social media, communications on the Internet (such as on websites for social networking and microblogging)
        through which users share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos). Social
        networking and social media are overlapping concepts, but social networking is usually understood as users
        building communities among themselves while social media is more about using social networking sites and related
        platforms to build an audience.

        The earliest forms of social media appeared almost as soon as technology could support them. E-mail and chat
        programs debuted in the early 1970s, but persistent communities did not surface until the creation of the
        discussion group network USENET in 1979. USENET allowed users to post and receive messages within subject areas
        called newsgroups. USENET and other discussion forums, such as privately hosted bulletin board systems (BBSs),
        enabled individuals to interact, but each was essentially a closed system. With the release in 1993 of the
        Mosaic web browser, those systems were joined with an easy-to-use graphical interface. The architecture of the
        World Wide Web made it possible to navigate from one site to another with a click, and faster Internet
        connections allowed for more multimedia content than could be found in the text-heavy newsgroups.</p>
