        Hanuman became more important in the medieval period and came to be portrayed as the ideal devotee (bhakta) of
        Rama.[32] Hanuman's life, devotion, and strength inspired wrestlers in India.[90]

        According to Philip Lutgendorf, devotionalism to Hanuman and his theological significance emerged long after the
        composition of the Ramayana, in the 2nd millennium CE. His prominence grew after the arrival of Islamic rule in
        the Indian subcontinent.[10] He is viewed as the ideal combination of shakti ("strength, heroic initiative and
        assertive excellence") and bhakti ("loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama").[15] Beyond wrestlers,
        he has been the patron god of other martial arts. He is stated to be a gifted grammarian, meditating yogi and
        diligent scholar. He exemplifies the human excellences of temperance, faith and service to a cause
        Hanuman was the son of Kesari, a vanar, and the grandson of Brihaspati, the king of Sumeru. His mother Anjana,
        was an apsara of the heavens and had descended to the earth as human, due to a curse. She and her husband had
        performed 12 years of penance and intense prayers due to which, Shiva granted them a child, as a boon. The child
        was Hanuman himself, due to which he is also interpreted as the reflection or shadow of Lord Shiva himself.
        Other mythological accounts often called Hanuman, as the son of The God of Wind, Vayu Dev, due to the popular
        story of the Wind God delivering a sacred pudding to Anjana, which originated from King Dasharatha’s ritual of
        Putrakama Yagya. The same pudding was had by the three wives of King Dasharatha, leading to the birth of Rama,
        Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. This pudding was delivered to her while performing her prayers to Shiva, who
        steered the Vayu God’s energy into the womb of Anjana. Hence, Hanuman is popularly known as Vayuputra.</P>

       <p>Hanuman’s childhood tales are a source of great entertainment, told by grandmothers to the children. Hanuman was
        a very adventurous and restless child. He is believed to have mistaken the sun to be a ripe and mango, and he
        pursued it in order to eat it. Rahu, a Vedic planet, was also pursuing the Sun at that time for a scheduled
        eclipse, and Hanuman thrashed him in order to reach the Sun first. This angered Lord Indra, who struck Hanuman
        with a thunderbolt. Hanuman fell back to the earth, unconscious, and also damaged his chin, leaving a permanent
        mark on it. This incident enraged Vayu Dev, his father figure, who sucked out all the air from the universe.
        When all the humans and animals began to struggle for air, Lord Indra withdrew the effect of his thunderbolt,
        and revived Hanuman, and was also blessed with multiple boons, by the devas, to pacify the Wind God.
